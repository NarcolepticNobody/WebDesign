                <p class="post-preview">
                    Flexbox is one of the most powerful tools in modern web design, allowing designers to align, space,
                    and center content
                    with ease. In this post, we'll explore how Flexbox simplifies layouts that once required endless
                    floats and margins—and
                    how a few key properties can make your designs more fluid and responsive.
