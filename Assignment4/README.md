I had fun with the flex boxes, and hope to use them more as I get better with webpages. I had a hard time once I was in the flex box I wanted to have a clickable word that brought me to my blog page. I am not sure if that is possible or I can't lable it as a navigation tab maybe?
It will be nice to be able to use these boxes and add additional elements inside them to add more creativity. This will be nice to add additional flexibility (pun intended lol) with designing. 
I was able to add the page through using the nav option!! Not my best looking site but I am excited to build on this! I also don't think I have four pages because I accidently added to my index and the other file vs making two additional ones. I also forgot to make a copy of the folder for this week so I don't have last weeks lol. I'm falling apart over here.
