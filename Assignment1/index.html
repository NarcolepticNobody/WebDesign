<h1>Tree Girl</h1>


<h2>By Ben Mikaelsen</h2>


<p>I probably shouldn't have read this book at the age I did because it was very graphic for my age group. I am not even sure why we had it in our library. They let me have it out of the "restricted section" I was in third grade. I liked the author and the book stands out to me because of the sadness of gorilla warfare and what this girls village went through.</p>
