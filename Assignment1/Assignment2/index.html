<h1>First Flight</h1>

<h2>Soren and Klaudd take their first flight by gliding from branch to branch to build up their flying strength.</h2>
<br></br>
<p>Noctus and Marella the owlets parents, are teaching them to glide on the branches. Soren is the first to get going and makes it to the branch, while Klaudd isn't as good at gliding at first. He is really mean towards Soren as well when he tries to help him.</p>
